## Welcome to GitHub Pages for GX-Plug

GX-plug is a middleware for the ease of integrating the merits of both distributed system for scale-out, and emerging hardwares for scale-up, serving graph processing. As a middleware, the GX-plug is versatile in supporting different runtime environments, computation models, and programming models. GX-Plug offers general and coder-friendly programming interfaces for algorithm developers, and good encapsulation of components for secondary system development. More, for improving the middleware performance, it integrates a series of techniques for intra-, inter-, and beyond-iteration optimizations, respectively.
